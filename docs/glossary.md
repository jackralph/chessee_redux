# Glossary of terms

## Abandonment Move

A `move` which leaves the king in check

## Continual Piece

A continual `piece` is one which can continue attacking through one of it's own pieces (as a form of backup), examples of continual pieces are:

- diagonal
  - `"bishop"`
  - `"queen"`
- straight
  - `"queen"`
  - `"rook"`

## Legal Moves

`move`(s) that a `piece` could make if there were no constraints such as **abandonment moves**

## All Moves

`square`(s) that a `piece` attacks/defends but does **not** necessarily mean a `piece` can move there, for instance a `"pawn"` can defend a `square` diagonal from itself, this would be marked regardless of whether the `"pawn"` can **legally** move to that square or not as it "defends" that `square`
